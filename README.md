# HestiaHUD - A Customizable Web Dashboard

Welcome to HestiaHUD! This project is a highly customizable dashboard that runs entirely in your web browser.

## Key Features

HestiaHUD is built around three core features that you can personalize entirely.

### 1. Dashboard Layout and Grid Management

The main area is a responsive grid where you can arrange your app cards.

* **Edit Mode:** Click the **Edit** button in the top right to start moving things around.
* **Moving and Resizing:** Once in edit mode, you can drag cards to reposition them or use the bottom-right handle to change their size.
* **Renaming:** Double-click a card's title to rename it.

### 2. Deep Customization via Settings

Click the **Settings** button to open the customization panel. You have full control over the look and feel.

* **Themes & Colors:** Choose a Base16 preset palette or dive in with individual color pickers to fine-tune every color, from the canvas background to brand colors and status indicators.
* **Layout Adjustments:** Change the font, adjust the gap size between cards, and modify the corner radius to nail the exact aesthetic you want.
* **Custom Presets:** Found a perfect look? Save it as a custom preset so you can easily switch back to it later.

### 3. Client-Side Persistence

All your hard work is automatically saved in your browser.

* **Automatic Saving:** Your layout changes (card positions, sizes, names) and all theme settings are stored locally.
* **Persistence:** Close the page, come back later, and everything will be exactly as you left it.
